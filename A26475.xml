            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am often in very great doubt (if I may ſo ſpeak), that the Goodneſs &amp; Wiſdom of God, <hi>&amp; his thoughts of theſe,</hi> are very rarely met with, in the Paths, which the ſcanthing of Man's Reaſon and Judgment walk in; And as I dare not but own the Belief of the Coming of his Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and the breaking forth, very ſhortly, of his Glorie: So I believ likewiſe, this will bee a ſight very ſtrange, and very unexſpected to men; and not onely great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above, but in ſom meaſure even contrarie (and perhaps, very unwelcom) unto the moſt enlarged and raiſed thoughts wee have yet prepared our ſelvs with, to receiv it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſign</hi> of which Coming, will bee the Detection, by little and little, of all <hi>Impoſture,</hi> and the laying of all things low, naked, and mean before him; the ſtripping men of that Honor, Credit, and Repute, that they had by ſeveral means been gaining with themſelvs, (and by themſelvs) with others, either through
<pb facs="tcp:59239:3"/>a Not-knowledg, or through an artificial concealing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs.</p>
            <p>In <hi>theſe very things</hi> (if well obſerved) lying, and within <hi>theſe</hi> indeed, beeing ſpent and conſumed, the whole Indeavors, Practice, Studie and Wiſdom (if not Religion) of <hi>All</hi> States, Ages, Nations and Men, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>Either in deviſing ſhifts (by acquiſition of ſuch and ſuch Power, Habits, or otherwiſe) not to appear uncomly to themſelvs, but to beget rather agreatneſs, eſteem and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in themſelvs, and others of themſelvs;</item>
               <item>Or, in Concealing and keeping cloſe (by ſeveral Gloſſes) the Imperfections, weakneſſes, and uncomlineſſes, (known to themſelvs) from the ſight and apprehenſions of others;</item>
            </list>
            <p>The more exquiſite Wit exceeding the more inferior onely in this, that the former is able to finde out more tight and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite textures for it ſelf then the other; And the moſt fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate man in this world, having the Advantage of the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, but after the ſame manner alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> that the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this fall's off a little ſooner, and the other wrap's him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up in it a while longer.</p>
            <p>For thus all Luſts whatſoever (whether thoſe of Acquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) in the minde (or others to exterior things) both in their firſt Iſſuings forth, and in their utmoſt Accompliſhments, are ſtill but either to give countenance unto, or further to heap up akinde of greatneſs, Repute and Eſteem in us for us. The Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (on the other ſide) of a Repute and Esteemence to our ſelvs, is, That which after give's a kinde of lawfulneſs, boldneſs, and currancy (during it) to all Luſts. (Theſe two, obſerving tune, and holding time each to the meaſures and motions of the other) and within this Circle therefore is concluded <hi>whole Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature,</hi> with all the Parts, and the moſt perfect Actions of it.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon theſe thoughts <hi>(Right Honorable!)</hi> I finding none not very ready to have aſſcribed to himſelf the name of beeing (in ſom meaſure) wiſe, <hi>becauſ it is eſtimable,</hi> finde none that can
<pb facs="tcp:59239:3"/>endure the Manifeſtation (in any kinde) of their Follie; or that can bee willing to have this their Wiſdom and Glorie to bee flatly and plainly called a Pageantrie, Mumming, or playing at bo-peep with themſelvs and others; and yet (it really beeing no honester) if wee cannot bear the Judgments thus one of another, how ſhall wee abide the Trial, or bee able to ſtand before the Judgment of God, which ſeeth us, (and will ſhortly ſearch us) with more pure and uncorrupt Eies? And how miſerably then are the Imaginations of almoſt all men muffled up here in their own dreſsings? when the Truth moſt certainly is in our Beeings, at their beſt (natural, or acquir'd) Appearances, are yet ſuch feign'd Things, and Propp'd up with ſuch Lyes and fundamental mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes of themſelvs, that they would (<hi>Belſhazzer</hi> like,) moulder and ſhatter themſelvs to pieces, ſhould they bee taken quite aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the diſguiſes and patchings they have put upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, bare-facedly and undeceivedly to ſee themſelvs but one ſmall part of an hour.</p>
            <p>Beeing convinced, by theſe, therefore <hi>(Right Honorable!)</hi> of the low Condition wee are herein, I not knowing what the Councils of God intend to bring forth for the ſettlement of this Nation; Nor how hee hath reſolved in his Wiſdom to diſpoſe of it, (as to its outward Condition,) whether Hee intend's wee ſhall bee oppreſſed by other Nations about us, that hee may the more manifeſt his Power and Protection over us: Or that wee ſhall bee advanced in Proſperitie above others, that ſo hee may perhaps ſhew us our vanitie (the caſting of the Scale either way in appearance much depending upon the preſent Councils) I ſay, not knowing this, I can as little judge what means Providence will pleaſ to uſe in order to the bringing to paſs theſe his purpoſes, whether hee will chuſe This, or reject That.</p>
            <p>But in this Caſe, notwithstanding remembring the advice of <hi>Solomon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 11.5, 6.</note> and knowing nothing (for I do affirm it but as to mine own underſtanding) that hath preſented it ſelf in this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, of more Import to bee looked after, or to bee very heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully taken into Conſideration, then Matters of <hi>Trade,</hi> (if wee

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For,
<list>
                  <item n="1">1. By this wee encouraged the building more and more
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59239:6"/>of our Neighbors Shipping, and diſcouraged our own; which hereupon were laid up by the walls in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</item>
                  <item n="2">2. VVee encreaſed (by this) their great Trade for the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, and <hi>Eaſt-land,</hi> and gave them ſtill the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opportunitie to make themſelvs the Mart and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters over us, of all Commodities belonging to the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or furniſhing of Shipping, whereby their Trade ſtill came home in a Circle; they (like wiſe men) laying ſuch a Courſ, as one part of it ſtrengthened another.</item>
                  <item n="3">3. VVee diſ-obliged and diſcontented our own people and ſea-men, and inſenſibly weakned the ſtrength and defence of this Nation: For by this courſ, wee muſt at length have been reduced to have hired their Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, when wee come to ſet out our Men of War: nor was it poſsible (had it held) to have prevented it.</item>
                  <item n="4">4. They, by this means, carried away much unneceſſarie Treaſure out of this Nation, taken for Freights; and ſo inſenſibly impoveriſhed alſo this Countrie; our monie occaſioning a Luxe to their people, while our own Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſtarved at home for meer want, and through lack of imploiment.</item>
                  <item n="5">5. And as the Cheapneſs of their Freight enabled them to under-ſell us abroad, in many Commodities carried to forreign Markets by them, &amp; by us, to ſell: So it enabled them equally to over-bid us abroad for the Forreign Commodities, which they and wee bought, and to raiſ the price of them upon us, which while they had liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to bring in hither, they either prevented our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant of the firſt of the Market, and then made us paie Sauce for them: or, if not, they carried them into their Countrie: or here watched the opportunitie of another ſeaſonable vent of them. And thus they ſerved us, as for all our <hi>Norwey, Eaſt-land,</hi> and <hi>Ruſsia</hi> Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; ſo alſo lately in our VVines, Fruits, Oils, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59239:7"/>&amp;c. which were the Commodities of <hi>Spain, Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and the <hi>Streights:</hi> By both theſe means (<hi>viz.</hi> by diſcouraging and beating us down abroad in the ſelling of ſom Commodities; and by raiſing and enhaunſing us abroad in the price, or buying up of others) concluding with themſelvs, to wearie us out at length from all Trade, and to have the ſole buying and ſelling of all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities for us.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For this method and manner of managing their affairs, daily adding to <hi>their</hi> ſtock, and anſwerably diminiſhing the Stock and Treaſure of <hi>this Nation:</hi> and by laying it ſo, as it <hi>run</hi> thus in a Circle, each part of it (as wee ſaid) ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning another part: it would unavoidably have tended to a greater and greater diſenabling us to hold anie Trade with them: and to have made themſelvs, for Wealth and Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, the Maſters over us: A ſufficient teſtimonie of which (over and above what wee have ſaid alſo) wee might fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee in the actual progreſs that they had gained upon us in our Shipping.</p>
            <p>For,
<list>
                  <item n="1">1. In our Trade of <hi>Eaſt-land,</hi> whereas wee did uſe former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſend thither 200 Sail of Shipping in a year, wee now did not ſend 16 Sail: The <hi>Hollanders</hi> in the mean time employing not leſs then 600 Sail thither; and whereby <note place="margin">☞</note> (had not a good Providence croſſed or hindered a ſtrict Alliance and Conjunction between ſom of thoſe Eaſtern States and them) wee muſt ſoon have given them their Price, and been at their diſpoſing for all Commodities belonging to Shipping: and then it had been too great an hazard for us (by anie Law made here) to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered our Trade from them.</item>
                  <item n="2">2. In our Plantations they had three, if not four Sail of Ships, for our one: whereas they never ſuffered us ſo
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59239:7"/>much as to Trade at all in any place or Plantation ſettled by them.</item>
                  <item n="3">3. In <hi>India</hi> they have 20 Sail, and above, for our one.</item>
                  <item n="4">4. At <hi>Spain, Canaries, Zant,</hi> with ſeveral other places in the <hi>Streights,</hi> where they formerly rarely laded hither one ſhip of Goods; they now lately laded hither more then wee.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And thus, in the waie and manner of the managing the Trade in their ſhipping, laie much of their vigilancie to gain their advantage and deſign upon us.</p>
            <p>A <hi>ſecond</hi> Courſ (therefore) whereby they do and have upheld their advantages above us, is, The greatneſs of the Stock they emploie, which (as wee now intimated) was more and more increaſed by the wiſdom of this their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in Shipping: And which, on the other ſide, as it did encreaſ and grow great, did enable them the more to give the Laws of Trade to us, both in the Government of the Exchange, and of the Markets abroad for Forreign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</p>
            <p>A <hi>third</hi> Courſ for the gaining and upholding their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of us, was, The ſingular and prudent care they took in preſerving the Credit of moſt of thoſe Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are their own proper Manufactures; By which they keep up the Repute and Sale of them abroad; taking hereby a very great advantage of the contrarie Neglect in us; and by this means, likewiſe, very much damnifying and ſpoiling us.</p>
            <p>Which that wee may clearly ſee of what Import this one thing alone is to us, wee ſhall here ſet down certain general <hi>Canons,</hi> or <hi>Rules,</hi> belonging to Manufactures.</p>
            <list>
               <item n="1">1. That although Divine Providence, in the greatneſs of his Wiſdom, hath placed natural commodities, ſom here, ſom there; yet no Manufacture or artificial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, but may poſsibly bee had on tranſplanted into anie Countrie.</item>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59239:8"/>
               <item n="2">2. That all Manufactures (eſpecially ſuch as are of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie) if they are of a certain goodneſs, They are (like Coin) of a certain value and price alſo; and ſo on the contrarie. If of an uncertain goodneſs, They, &amp;c.</item>
               <item n="3">3. That two perſons ſelling or making commodities of a like goodneſs, hee ſhall have the preference of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, that will ſell them the cheapeſt. <hi>And ſo two Nations likewiſe.</hi>
               </item>
               <item n="4">4. That the cheapneſs of Manufactures, and artificial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, doth altogether depend upon the plentie and cheapneſs of the matter, and upon the like cheapneſs of price, for Handie-labor.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And theſe (though few) beeing unalterable Laws in all Manufactures, it cannot but bee acknowledged, that it is through our want of the like Care, as our Neighbors, and onely through that, that the <hi>Hollander</hi> hath anie kinde of Woollen Manufacture:</p>
            <p>For,
<list>
                  <item n="1">1. The matter of no VVoollen Manufacture groweth in his Countrie at all; but hee is forced to fetch it from other places; whereas wee have it here, within this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, plentie.</item>
                  <item n="2">2. The price of labor depending much upon the price of victuals, houſ-rent, and other things neceſſarie, It is certain (eſpecially to any that know both Countries) that all this is much cheaper with us, then with our Neighbors, and are like ſo to bee.</item>
                  <item n="3">3. Our Nation, as they were heretofore the onely work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of theſe commodities; ſo none can excel them for Art, Skill, or Goodneſs, were but encouragement given them, and an Order, Regulation, and Government of the Manufactures ſettled among them: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>It is not our Neighbor's ſingular Induſtrie above us, or a power they have to work cheaper then us; ſo much as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59239:8"/>it is the Careleſneſs of this Nation, in keeping our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures to their due contents, weight, and goodneſs. Their Neglect in ſettling a Regulation, Government, and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection over them, and in Inflicting due and juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the falſ-making of them. That is (humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to bee) the Cauſ of the ſo great thriving of our Neighbor's Cloathing, and of the ſo great Ruine and Decaie (on the contrarie) of our own Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, and of the people depending upon them.</p>
            <p>A <hi>fourth</hi> Courſ taken by our Neighbors, Is, The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of Trade that they have made by their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Articles of Confederations with other Princes; <hi>and by making this their Care and Protection of Trade abroad in all places their Intereſt of State.</hi> Thus taking hold of the Juncture of Circumſtances, and making uſe of the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> they have farmed the <hi>Sound</hi> of him: Thus alſo at the Treatie of <hi>Munſter</hi> have they reſerved a power of ſhutting us out of the <hi>Scheld,</hi> and have carefully in that Peace concluded on ſeveral other Articles and Proviſions in order to the ſecuring and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of their Traffick. And thus—&amp;c.</p>
            <p>A <hi>fifth</hi> Courſ (and not the leaſt means for the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding and encreaſing their Trade) Is, The ſmalneſs of their Cuſtom, or Port-duties; alſo their prudent laying on and taking off Impoſitions, for the furtherance of their own Manufactures, and for the Incouragement of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſom, and Diſcouragement of bringing in other Commodities; and of which they have given us two ill Inſtances, The one in laying on a great Tax upon our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloths and Manufactures; The other in forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our Cloths wholly to bee imported, if dreſt or died in the Cloth; of both which wee have had ſom cauſ to complain long, as beeing plainly an Inhibition of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and if not ſtrictly againſt the Laws of Nations; yet
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59239:9"/>at leaſt againſt the Courſ of Amitie, Alliance, and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>A <hi>ſixt</hi> way hath been, The Conſtant Reward and Incouragement given to perſons bringing in Inventions; making of new Diſcoveries, and propounding things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for publick and common intereſt: which (how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a thing ſoever it may ſeem to ſom, yet it hath ever been, and is conſtantly, a very great ſpur to Induſtrie.</p>
            <p>And theſe are humbly aſſerted to bee the principal Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their ſo much greatneſs and flouriſhing in Trade above us.</p>
            <p>Other Cauſes that have been leſs principal and acceſſarie to theſe, are,
<list>
                  <item n="1">1. The Eaſineſs or Lowneſs of Intereſt in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</item>
                  <item n="2">2 The great facilitating of their Trade by a Bank.</item>
                  <item n="3">3. And laſt of all (the onely thing proper to them) the dearneſs and ſcarcitie of Land: and the dividing their Eſtates equally to their children: whereby Trade is (as it were) continued in a Line without Interruption; the contrarie beeing cuſtomarie with us,</item>

                  <head>I.</head>
                  <p>That our Neighbors have no ſuch extraordinarie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in matter of Trade, either through their Countrie, its Situation, or otherwiſe, as is proper or peculiar to them only, beyond all other Nations, (as hath been long the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59239:9"/>of ſom) but it is the manner of their Care, and of the Government that is among them, and the meer vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancie over Trade, that is obſerved by them:</p>
                  <p>For,</p>
                  <p>If the Nature of thoſe Courſes, which they have taken and purſued for the Incouragement of Trade, bee looked into and conſidered (as they are obvious to any other that will pleaſ to heed them) it cannot bee imagined but they ſhall make any people great, rich and flouriſhing in Trade, that uſeth them; and therefore that they will do the like in anie other place as well as in <hi>Holland,</hi> if put in execution, eſpecially, if it bee a place, as this of ours is, ſeated for Trade, and the people of the Countrie apt for it.</p>

                  <p>It is preſumed, That our Neighbors would not think it juſt, if wee ſhould condemn them, meerly for the taking theſe good Courſes for themſelvs; or becauſ they have given all Incouragements that were requiſite to their Trade in their own Countrie: Much leſs then would they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that wee ſhould actually impute theſe things as Crimes to them, or ground hence anie occaſion to Eſtrange our ſelvs, or make a Breach with them: Nor will our neighbors therefore (as it is hoped) take it more ill from us, if wee (having now likewiſe recovered our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties) ſee the Neceſsitie of providing for the Defence of this Common-wealth by Shipping (as beeing <hi>Iſlanders</hi>); or if wee take up ſom of the like Courſes as They, for the Incouragement of Trade among us: VVithout which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Shipping can neither bee had, or mainteined; which now alſo to neglect, were a very great Careleſneſs, and would, indeed, bee rather a Reproach to us then otherwiſe; having been ſo well taught, even by their own Example and Practice, That
